                    Gateway to the vast tourism experiences of Madera County and the southern Yosemite region, the City of Madera offers travel services and tourist amenities for nearly everyone. Restaurants, gas stations, and affordable lodging are readily available. Madera serves as the hub for visitors accessing the region from the west on Highway 152, and from the north and south on State Highway 99 traveling to Yosemite National Park or the Sierra National Forest via the Southern Yosemite Highway 41.

Home to the Madera District Fairgrounds, special events and celebrations as well as the Fair itself draw visitors to Madera annually. Other events listed in this directory also appeal to visitors from around the San Joaquin Valley and other parts of California.

Of special note is the Madera Wine Trail. Sponsored and organized by the Madera Vintners Association, the wine trail features some of Californiaâ€™s finest wines. The Vintners host several events each year drawing people from all around the area. For tasting times and appointment information, visit their website or stop by the Chamber office for a copy of their Wine Trail Map.

Each year the Yosemite Sierra Visitors Bureau publishes a regional Visitors Guide. This colorful and informative guide to the southern Yosemite region is ideal for planning your next outing in the area or for sending to friends coming to visit. It is also a great tool along with this directory for showing clients about our area. Contact the Madera District Chamber office for your free copy.

Tourism is an important economic development tool for Madera County. Over $195 million dollars in visitor spending occurs annually. This includes spending for accommodations, food and beverage, fuel, recreation, entertainment and shopping. Over 3,000 jobs are generated by tourism with earnings of about $67 million. Local tax receipts generated by travel spending exceeded $3.2 million in 2006. The Transient Occupancy Tax (T.O.T.) or Bed Tax has reached over $1.8 million per year. The County of Madera collected $1,863,968 in T.O.T. for the fiscal year 2007-08. The City of Madera accounts for an additional $426,000 per year in T.O.T. that goes into the city general fund.
